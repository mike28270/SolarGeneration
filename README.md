# SolarGeneration

## Introduction
With the increase of renewable energy generation and decentralized in power grids for instance wind farms and solar plants, dynamical stability of power grids becomes more important and challenging. In order to maintain stability of power grids, the data will be analyse and focus on the prediction of the values.

## Description
• The data collected from two solar power plants in India over a 34 day period.
• Each of the plants consists of two datasets which are a power generation dataset recorded by inverters and a weather dataset gathered by sensors at solar panels.
• The task is to predict energy produced daily by solar power plants.

##Data source
The dataset can be found and download at Kaggle via a topic called Solar Power Generation Data. [link](https://www.kaggle.com/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data)
